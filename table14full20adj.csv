"(1) Error ranges are calculated at the 90-percent confidence interval, which means that if repeated samples were drawn from the same population and an error range constructed around each sample estimate, in 9 out of 10 cases the true value based on a complete census of the population would be contained within these error ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Error ranges cannot be properly computed when the number of sample cases is very small or the unemployment rate is too low.,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Fewer than 500 people.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: Data for demographic groups are not shown when the labor force base does not meet the BLS publication standard of reliability for the area in question, as determined by the sample size. Items may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates for the race groups shown in the table do not sum to totals because data are not presented for all races. In addition, people whose ethnicity is identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race and, therefore, are classified by ethnicity as well as by race.",,,,,,,,,,,
