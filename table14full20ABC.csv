"Note: Data for demographic groups are not shown when the labor force base does not meet the BLS publication standard of reliability for the area in question, as determined by the sample size. Items may not sum to totals because of rounding. Estimates for the race groups shown in the table do not sum to totals because data are not presented for all races. In addition, people whose ethnicity is identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race and, therefore, are classified by ethnicity as well as by race.",,,,,,,,,,,
